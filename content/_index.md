Hey there! I'm a software engineer, reverse-engineer and general computing enthusiast.

I've just finished studying Computer Science at Queen's University Belfast.

Things are pretty barren here at the moment, the "real" content is coming soon.

### Some of my projects
#### Unreleased

* Work on audio code decompilation and porting to OpenAL with an SDL3 core for the _ACTION_ engine, as part of the team studying this game.
* Some limited work on debugging and researching the _DRIVING_ engine's audio code.
* (more to come)
